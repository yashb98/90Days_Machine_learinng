# üìò Sentiment Analysis API with Flask | Days 16‚Äì17 of #90DaysMLChallenge

This project wraps a Word2Vec + TF-IDF weighted Logistic Regression sentiment model into a Flask API, now fully containerized using Docker .  

It marks a key milestone ‚Äî taking machine learning from notebook ‚Üí API ‚Üí container ‚Üí deploy-ready application. 

---

##  Overview
- Trained a custom Word2Vec model on IMDB reviews to learn text embeddings.
- Combined TF-IDF weights to emphasize informative words.
- Built a Logistic Regression classifier for sentiment prediction.
- Deployed using Flask for real-time inference.
- Containerized the full app using Docker for consistent deployment anywhere.

---

##  Tech Stack
- Python 3.12
- Flask (API backend)
- scikit-learn (ML model)
- gensim (Word2Vec embeddings)
- NumPy, pickle, joblib
- Docker üê≥ (Containerization)

##  Run Locally

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Setup virtual environment**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows

2Ô∏è‚É£ Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

3Ô∏è‚É£ Run Flask API

python app.py

Your API will run at:
üëâ http://127.0.0.1:8000

‚∏ª

 Test API

Using curl or Postman:

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"text": "I absolutely loved this movie!"}'

 Expected Output:

{
  "text": "I absolutely loved this movie!",
  "predicted_sentiment": "positive"
}


‚∏ª

 Using Docker (Step-by-Step)

If you have Docker installed, you can run the API without installing Python or dependencies.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Build Docker Image

docker build -t sentiment-flask-app .

2Ô∏è‚É£ Verify Image

docker images

You should see:

REPOSITORY              TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
sentiment-flask-app     latest    123abc456def   2 minutes ago    650MB

3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Container

docker run -p 8000:8000 sentiment-flask-app

API is now live inside Docker:
üëâ http://127.0.0.1:8000

4Ô∏è‚É£ Test the API (Inside Docker)

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"text": "This film was terrible!"}'

Expected Response:

{
  "text": "This film was terrible!",
  "predicted_sentiment": "negative"
}

5Ô∏è‚É£ (Optional) Push to Docker Hub

docker tag sentiment-flask-app yashbishnoi98/sentiment-flask-app:latest
docker push yashbishnoi98/sentiment-flask-app:latest


‚∏ª

 Use Cases

This sentiment analysis API can be used for:
	‚Ä¢	Product Reviews Analysis ‚Äì Analyze user reviews to quickly gauge sentiment trends.
	‚Ä¢	Social Media Monitoring ‚Äì Detect public opinion on topics, hashtags, or campaigns.
	‚Ä¢	Chatbots & Customer Support ‚Äì Automatically identify positive or negative messages for better response prioritization.
	‚Ä¢	Content Moderation ‚Äì Flag negative or abusive text in forums, comments, or feedback systems.
	‚Ä¢	Market Research ‚Äì Aggregate sentiment from multiple sources to inform business decisions.

‚∏ª

What‚Äôs Next (Day 18)

 Add a React + Tailwind CSS frontend to interact with this API visually ‚Äî making sentiment predictions more intuitive and user-friendly.
